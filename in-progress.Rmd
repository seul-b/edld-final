# Research Question
**Do the teacher-reported student math scores over two separate time periods (i.e., base year and first follow-up) correlate with 1) students' sex, 2) students' race/ethnicity, and 3) mother's highest education level of students?**

## SUGGESTION: Great research question! I reworded it a bit to make it a little easier to read. 

# Data Information
## Variables
### Independent Variables: 
##### 1.[BYSEX]
#######  1 = "Male"
#######  2 = "Female"
####### -4 = "Nonrespondent"
####### -8 = "Survey component legitimate skip/NA"
##### 2. [BYRACE]
#######  1 = "Amer. Indian/Alaska Native, non-Hispanic"
#######  2 = "Asian, Hawaii/Pac. Islander,non-Hispanic"
#######  3 = "Black or African American, non-Hispanic"
#######  4 = "Hispanic, no race specified"
#######  5 = "Hispanic, race specified"
#######  6 = "More than one race, non-Hispanic"
#######  7 = "White, non-Hispanic"
#######  -4 = "Nonrespondent"
#######  -8 = "Survey component legitimate skip/NA"
##### 3. [BYMOTHED]
#######  1 = "Did not finish high school"
#######  2 = "Graduated from high school or GED"
#######  3 = "Attended 2-year school, no degree"
#######  4 = "Graduated from 2-year school"
#######  5 = "Attended college, no 4-year degree"
#######  6 = "Graduated from college"
#######  7 = "Completed Master's degree or equivalent"
#######  8 = "Completed PhD, MD, other advanced degree"
#######  -4 = "Nonrespondent"
#######  -8 = "Survey component legitimate skip/NA"
#######  -9 = "Missing"

## QUESTION/SUGGESTION: Wow! You have a lot to work with here - super cool! I did notice, however, that the categories under each independent variable seems to be ordered in numerical order starting with 1 and then it tapers off to negative values. Sorry if I'm just missing the answer - is there a reason why -4 indicates "Nonrespondent", -8 indicates "N/A", and -9 indicates "Missing" as opposed to using other numbers for measurement? If not already stated, maybe explaining the rationale for assigning values could be helpful!

### Dependent Variables: 
##### 1. [BYTXMSTD] Math test standardized score 
####### Description: Math standardized T Score. The standardized T score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (spring 2002 10th-graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared to peers (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated number-right score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items). The standardized T score is a transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, rescaled to a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10.
##### 2. [F1TXMSTD] F1 math test standardized score 
####### Description: Math standardized T Score. The standardized T score provides a norm-referenced measurement of achievement, that is, an estimate of achievement relative to the population (spring 2004 12th-graders) as a whole. It provides information on status compared with peers (as distinguished from the IRT-estimated number-right score which represents status with respect to achievement on a particular criterion set of test items). Although the T score is reported for all F1 in-school responding students (including transfer students), regardless of grade level, the comparison group for standardizing is the 12th grade population. The standardized T score is a transformation of the IRT theta (ability) estimate, and has a mean of 50 and standard deviation of 10 for the weighted subset of 12th-graders in the sample.


## STRENGTH: Your team did a great job describing the different dependent variables. Very thorough!

# Honestly I don't love the visualization, so let's look at a box plot of the data.

# How about a density plot?

## SUGGESTION: This visualization looks so freaking awesome! There is a lot going on at once though, which may make it a little difficult to follow. Maybe it would be helpful to break up the data a little bit or reconfigure a bit so that the labels/titles are little more clear/methodical?

```

## Boxplots
A boxplot of the standardized math scores by Race, Sex, and Mother's education.  

```{r visualization 4, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## STRENGTH: I'm so impressed with these plots, especially the Math Score by Mother Education one. It's very clear and easy to follow.

## Density Plots

Finally let's examine the data using density plots.
```{r visualization 5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

## LEARNED SOMETHING!: These plots are so neatly displayed. Great job! Bonus points for the way that the colors are organized - super satisfying. This is also giving me an idea to display data for my group's project, except instead of race, we're looking at age/generation.

# Visualization of the means by year. The t test suggests that there is a significant difference in scores by year, despite the means being similar, unfortunately, the mean of the follow up is significantly less than the base year. I was thinking we could focus on visualizing the data by race and mother's education and sex rather than comparing year 1 to year 2 data.

## STRENGTH: Overall, I think you have a lot of great data here and interesting modes of analysis. It's obvious your group took the time to really plan out how you'll be observing and interpreting your data. Bravo!

# Looks like I set white as the reference earlier.

## Mother Education / Race Regression  
I am not sure how to do a regression analysis of all three variables, but I can look at the regression analysis of math scores based on race/ethnicity and mother's education.   

```{r regression mother edu and race}
mod_moth_race <- lm(MATH ~ 1 + MOTHERED*RACE, data = els_viz)
summary(mod_moth_race)

```

### Mother Edu / Race Regression Visualization  
Now let's try to visualize this, it might get messy.  

```{r}
# Visualization of regression models for mother's education and race
#install.packages("interactions")
library(interactions)
cat_plot(mod_moth_race, pred = MOTHED, modx = RACE, geom = "line", interval = FALSE,vary.lty = TRUE)

```
